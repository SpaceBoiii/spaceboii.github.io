## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please report it to the email that is on my profile! 

I will try to contact you back about the vulnerability through the email as soon as possible.

If there is is an actual vulnerability, I will try my best to fix it as fast as I can. (Which will probably be slow, I'm a python programmer)
